# Alpha beta pruning algorithm on a binary game tree
We are in this assignment trying to analyse the values of Alpha and Beta in alpha beta pruning algorithm on a complete binary tree.
<br>
In the code we have analysed on two trees with representing arrays as:
- values1[ ] = {6,4,8,2,1,3,5}
- values2[ ] = {-3,7,4,-99,4,6,78,32,-10,11,49,12, 57,700,15}
